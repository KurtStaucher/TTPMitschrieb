\chapter{Quantization of Fields}

In classical mechanics we described a point particle with the action $S = \int \dd t L(q_i, \dot{q}_i)$ and the conjugate momentum $p_i = \frac{\p L}{\p \dot{q}_i}$. So we get pairs of coordinates $q$ and conjugate momenta, which are constructed by this. The quantization then followed from the condition $[q_i(t), p_j(t)] = i \hbar \delta_{ij}$. From this Lagrangian and the definition of the conjugate momentum we can impose the quantization condition on the Hamiltonian $H = \sum_i p_i \dot{q}_i - L$.\\
Now, looking at field theories, we can use the same basic structures. Here the $q_i(t)$ correspond to te vaules of the field at space time points $\phi_r(\vx,t)$ where $r$ and $\vx$ are just indices of the field, just like the $i$. The conjugate momenta here are defined as 
\[ \Pi_r(\vx, t) = \frac{\p \LL}{\p \dot{\phi}_r(\vx,t)}\]
as derived in a previous chapter.\\
We then postulate equal time commutators
\[ [\phi_r(\vx, t) , \Pi_s(\vy, t) ] = i \delta_{rs} \delta^{(3)}(\vx - \vy)\]
\[ [ \phi_r(\vx, t) , \phi_s( \vy, t) ] = 0 = [ \Pi_r(\vx, t), \Pi_s(\vy,t)]\]
where the times are equal, but the indices not neccesarily are. From this follows, that two fields at different space points are independant. These commutations only hold for fields with integer spin though. For fermion fields with spin $\frac{1}{2}$ the commutation in these relations will be replaced by the anticommutator.
\sub{Application: free, real Klein Gordon field}
For a free, real Klein Gordon field, the Lagrangian is $\LL = \frac{1}{2}( \p_\mu \phi)^2 - \frac{m^2}{2} \phi^2$, so the conjugate momentum is $\Pi(x) = \frac{\p \LL}{\p \dot{\phi}} = \dot{\phi}(x)$. From the commutation relation follows $[\phi(x), \Pi(y)]_{x^0=y^0} = i \delta( \vx-\vy)$, all other commutators at equal times vanish. Also, this Lagrangian yields an equation of motion known as the Klein Gordon equation, $\square \phi + m^2 \phi = 0$ where the solutions are superpositions of plane waves
\[ \phi(x) = \int \frac{\dd ^3 \vv{k}}{(2\pi)^3 2 \omega_k} \left( e^{-ikx}a(k) + e^{ikx}a^\dagger(k)\right)\]
with $\omega_k \equiv \sqrt{ \vv{k}^2 + m^2}$. These solutions are fundamentally hermitian.\\
To get a hand on $a(k)$ and $a^\dagger(k)$ we have to invert the fouriertransformation of $\phi(x)$. For this it is useful, to rewrite $e^{-ikx} = e^{-i\omega_kt}e^{i \vv{k}\vx}$ and the h.c. accordingly. Now, by integrating the field $\phi(x)$ we get
\[ \int \dd^3 \vx e^{-i\vp\vx}\phi(t, \vx) = \frac{1}{2\omega_p}\left( a(\vp) e^{-i\omega_p t} + a^\dagger(-\vp)e^{i \omega_p t}\right)\]
It is important to notice, that in this notation $\vp$ and $\vv{k}$ are two instances of the same thing. However, we do notice, that the integration of $\phi(x)$ on its on does not suffice to separate $a$ and $a^\dagger$, we also need the integration of the conjugate momentum
\[ \int \dd^3 \vx e^{-i \vp \vx} \underbrace{\Pi(t, \vx)}_{\dot{\phi}(t,\vx)} = \frac{i}{2} \left( - a (\vp) e^{-i \omega_p t} + a^\dagger(- \vp) e^{i \omega_p t}\right)\]
In the calculation of both these integrals we used
\[ \int \dd ^3 \vx e^{i(\vv{k} - \vp)\vx} = (2\pi)^3 \delta^{(3)}(\vp - \vv{k})\]
which in the $a^\dagger$ terms has a plus sign in the $\delta^{(3)}$ function which is why there are minus signs in the $\vp$ dependencies of $a^\dagger(-\vp)$. Now, looking at the sum of both integrations we get
\[ a(p,t) \equiv a(p) e^{-i\omega_p t} = \int \dd^3 \vx e^{-i \vp \vx} \left( \omega_p \phi(t, \vx) + i \Pi(t, \vx)\right)\]
and similarly for the h.c. case
\[ a^\dagger(p,t) \equiv e^{i \omega_p t} a^\dagger(\vp) = \int \dd^3 \vx e^{i \vp \vx} ( \omega_p \phi(t, \vx) - i \Pi(t, \vx) )\]
What we need to find out now, is, what the commutation relations for $a$ and $a^\dagger$ are:
\[ [a(\vp), a^\dagger( \vv{k}) ] = e^{i(\omega_p - \omega _k) t} \int \dd^3 x \dd^3 y e^{-i \vp \vx} e^{ i \vv{k} \vy} \cc [ \omega_p \phi(t, \vx) + i \Pi(t, \vx), \omega_k\phi(t, \vy) - i \Pi(t, \vy)]\]
In the commutator, only cross terms between $\phi$ and $\Pi$ have an impact, which yields
\[ [ \omega_p \phi(t, \vx) + i \Pi(t, \vx), \omega_k\phi(t, \vy) - i \Pi(t, \vy)] = \omega_p(-i)i\delta^{(3)}(\vx - \vy) + i \omega_k ( -i \delta^{(3)}(\vx - \vy)) = \delta^{(3)} ( \omega_p + \omega_k)\]
where the $\delta$-distribution in the second term got a minus sign, because the argument was switched around. With this, the Integration can be reduced to one variable, yielding 
\[ \int \dd^3 \vx e^{-i ( \vp - \vv{k} ) \vx} = (2\pi)^3 \delta^{(3)}(\vp - \vv{k})\]
Alltogether this gives
\[ [a(\vp) , a^\dagger( \vv{k})] = e^{i(\omega_p - \omega_p)t} (2\pi)^3 \delta^{(3)}(\vp - \vv{k}) ( \omega_p + \omega_p) = (2\pi)^3 2 \omega _p \delta^{(3)}(\vp - \vv{k})\]
In a similar calculation, the other commutator $[a(\vp), a(\vv{k})] = [a^\dagger(\vp), a^\dagger(\vv{k})] = 0$ follow.\\
Now, if we take a look at the field $\phi(x)$ in a primed frame
\[ \phi'(x') = \int \frac{\dd^3 \vv{k}'}{(2\pi)^3 w \omega_k'} \left( a'(k') e^{-i k'x'} + \hc\right) \soll \phi(x)\]
must be equal to $\phi(x)$, because the Klein Gordon equation is Lorentz invariant, and thus also the field must be equivalent to its boosted $\phi'(x')$. That means, $\phi(x)$ is a scalar field.\\
We now start from a Lorentz invariant measure $\dd ^4 k \delta( k^2 - m^2) \theta(k^0)$ which is invariant under an orthochronous Lorentz transformation, that is to say a transformation that doesnt change the sign of the $k^0$ component. Here, also $x'^\mu = \lambda^\mu_{~\nu} x^\nu$ and $k'^\mu = \Lambda^\mu_{~\nu}k^\nu$ also are Lorentz invariant. Now, any integral of a test function is $\int \dd^4 k\cc \delta(k^2 - m^2) \theta(k^0) f(k)$ where the $\delta$-function can be rewritten as
\[ \delta\left( (k^0)^2 - \vv{k}^2 - m^2\right) = \delta\left( (k^0)^2 - \omega_k^2\right) = \frac{1}{2 |k^0|} \left( \delta( k_0 - \omega_j) + \delta( k_0 + \omega_k)\right) \]
Now, because $k^0 > 0$ because of $\theta(k^0)$, the second term is equal to zero and therefore the integral yields
\[ \int \frac{\dd^3 \vv{k}}{2 \omega_k} f( k^0 = \omega_k, \vv{k})\]
This means, that this measure also is Lorentz invariant. So, $\frac{\dd^3 \vv{k}'}{2\omega_k'} = \frac{\dd^3 \vv{k}}{2 \omega_k}$ is the same, which then in turn leads to
\[ \phi'(x') = \int \frac{ \dd^3 \vv{k}}{2 \omega_k (2\pi)^3} \left( a'(k') e^{-i k x} + \hc\right) \soll \phi(x)\]
Thus, also $a(k)$ must be Lorentz invariant, so that $a(k) = a'(k')$. Which means, that $a(k)$ must be a Lorentz scalar.\\
As we will need the calculated measure for many more problems in the future, we will abbreviate it as $\dd \tilde{k} \equiv \frac{\dd^3 \vv{k}}{(2\pi)^3 2 \omega_k}$.\\
Now, the Hamiltonian and $\vp$ we get from the energy momentum tensor as derived in an eariler chapter are
\[ \mathcal{T}^{\mu\nu} = ( \p^\mu \phi)(\p_\mu \phi) - \LL g^{\mu\nu}, ~~~p^\nu = \int \dd^3 \vx \mathcal{T}^{0\nu}\]
and
\[ \vp = \int \dd^3 \vx \Pi(t,x)\left(-\vn \phi(t,\vx)\right)\]
which gives the Hamiltonian
\[ H = \frac{1}{2} \int \dd^3 \vx \left( \dot{\phi}^2(t,\vx) + ( \vn \phi)^2 + m^2 \phi^2\right)\]
With the field
\[ \phi(\vx, t) = \int \dd \tilde{k} \left[ a (\vv{k}) e^{-i \omega_k t} + a^\dagger(-\vv{k}) e^{i \omega_k t} \right] e^{i \vv{k}\vx}\]
and its derivative
\[ \dot{\phi}(\vx, t) = \int \dd \tilde{k}\cc i \omega_k \left[ -a(\vv{k}) e^{-i \omega_k t} + a^\dagger (-\vv{k}) e^{i \omega_k t} \right] e^{i \vv{k}\vx}\]
the Hamiltionian yields

\begin{align*}
H =& \frac{1}{2} \int \dd \tilde{k} \dd \tilde{p} \left[ - \omega_k \omega_p \left( - a(k) + a^\dagger(-k) \right)\left( -a(p) + a^\dagger(-p)\right) \right. \\
&+ \left. ( - \vv{k} \vp + m^2) \left( a(k) + a^\dagger(-k) \right) \left( a(p) + a^\dagger(-p)\right)\right] \int \dd^3 \vx e^{i \vv{k} \vx}e^{i \vp \vx}
\end{align*}
where the notation $a(k) = a(\vv{k})e^{-i\omega_kt}$ and $a^\dagger(-k) = a^\dagger(-\vv{k})e^{i\omega_kt}$ was used. The last integral over $\dd^3 \vx$ is equal to $(2\pi)^3 \delta^{(3)}(\vv{k} + \vp)$ which then implies $\vv{k} = - \vp$ and $\omega_k = \omega_p = \omega$.\\
Thus $-\vv{k}\vp + m^2 =  \vp^2 + m^2 = \omega_p^2$ and $-\omega_k \omega_p = -\omega_p^2$ yield twice the same factor for both terms in the first integral. Also the double integral at the front reduces to $\int \dd\tilde{p}\dd\tilde{k} = \int \frac{\dd\tilde{p}}{2 \omega_p (2\pi)^3}$. The $(2\pi)^3$ then cancels with the one from the last integral and the $\frac{1}{\omega_p}$ cancels with one of the now global $\omega_p^2$. All in all this reduces the Hamiltonian to
\[H = \frac{1}{2} \int \dd\tilde{p} \frac{\omega_p}{2} \left[ a(-\vp)a^\dagger(-\vp) + a^\dagger(\vp)a(\vp)\right] = \int \dd \tilde{p} \frac{\omega_p}{2} \left[a(\vp) a^\dagger(\vp) + a^\dagger(\vp) a(\vp) \right]\]
Here, all the time dependant phases $e^{i\omega t}$ vanish. This can further be rewritten by turning around the order of $a$ and $a^\dagger$ in the first term, such that
\[H = \int \dd \tilde{p} \cc\omega_p \left( a^\dagger(\vp) a(\vp) + \frac{1}{2}[ a(\vp), a^\dagger(\vp) ] \right)\]
The commutator here is equal to $[a(\vp), a^\dagger(\vp)] = (2\pi)^3 \omega_p \delta^{(3)}(0)$.
\section{Annihilation and Creationoperators}
If we take a look at the four momentum operator
\[P^\mu = \int \dd \tilde{k} k^\mu a^\dagger(k) a(k) + \ehm Q_0^\mu\]
with $k^\mu = (\omega_k, \vv{k})$ and $Q_0^\mu$ (?) we can show, that the $a$ and $a^\dagger$ are infact annihilation and creation operators.\\
Therefore, lets consider the eigenstate $|k\rk$ of $P^\mu$, $P^\mu|k\rk = k^\mu|k\rk$ and now calculate
\[ P^\mu\left( a^\dagger(p) |k\rk\right) = [ P^mu, a^\dagger(p)]|k\rk + a^\dagger(p) k^\mu|k\rk\]
The commutator is
\[ [P^\mu, a^\dagger(p)] = \int \dd \tilde{k}\cc k^\mu [ a^\dagger(k)a(k), a^\dagger(p)] = \int \dd \tilde{k}\cc k^\mu \left([ a^\dagger(k), a^\dagger(p)]a(k) + a^\dagger(k) [a(k), a^\dagger(p)]\right)\]
Now, the first commutator is equal to zero and the second one is known from before, $[a(k), a^\dagger(p)] = (2\pi)^3 2 \omega_k \delta^{(3)} (\vv{k} - \vp)$, thus
\[ [P^\mu, a^\dagger(p)] = \int \dd \tilde{k}\cc a^\dagger(k)(2\pi)^3 2 \omega_k \delta^{(3)}(\vv{k}-\vp) = p^\mu a^\dagger(p)\]
From which follows
\[ P^\mu \left( a^\dagger(p) |k\rk\right) = ( p + k )^\mu a^\dagger(p)\]
So we found, that applying $a^\dagger(p)$ to a state $|n\rk$ raises the energy by $\omega_p$ and the momentum by $\vp$, which is euqivalent to adding a new particle of four momentum $p^\mu$ to the state.\\
Similarly we get the commutator $[P^\mu, a(p)] = - p^\mu a(p)$ from is equivalent to taking away a particle of four momentum $p^\mu$ from the state.\\
Also, there is a ground state, or vacuum state $|0\rk$ with $a(k) |0\rk = 0 ~\forall k = (\omega_k, \vv{k})$.


\section{Fockspace, Hilbertspace}
The basis of the Hilbertspace (Fockspace) is given by the zero particle state, or vacuum state $|0\rk$, which is unique with the property $a(k)|0\rk = 0~\forall k$. All the other states are build by applying the creation operator onto the vacuum state.\\
For example, the one particle states are constructed as $a^\dagger(k_1)|0\rk = |k_1 \rk$, and the two particle states as $a^\dagger(k_1)a^\dagger(k_2)|0\rk = |k_1, k_2\rk$. This is the same as $a^\dagger(k_2)a^\dagger(k_1)|0\rk = + |k_2,k_1\rk$ because the $a^\dagger$ commute. Therefore, this is automatically Bose symmetric.\\
In the Hilbertspace, the momentum eigenstates are normailzed as distributions, the matrix element of two one particle states is
\[ \lk k_1 | k_2 \rk = \lk 0 | a(k_1)a^\dagger(k_2) | 0 \rk = \lk 0 | [ a(k_1), a^\dagger(k_2)] + a^\dagger(k_2) a(k_1)|0\rk\]
In the last step, the expression between the bra-ket was rewritten with the commutator. Now the extra term vanishes, because $a(k_1)|0\rk$ is zero, and the commutator can be calculated, which leads to
\[ \lk 0 | 0 \rk  (2\pi)^3 2 \omega_{k_1} \delta^{(3)}(\vv{k}_1 - \vv{k}_2)\]
Note, that the ground state is normalized to $\lk 0 | 0 \rk = 1$.\\
To nomalize a state, we have to look at a wave package, as a one particle state with a wafe function $f$:
\[ | 1 , f\rk = \int \dd \tilde{k} f(k) |k\rk\]
where $f(k)$ is the wave function in momentum space. The norm then is given by
\[ \| | 1, f\rk \|^2 = \lk 1, f| 1, f\rk = \int \dd\tilde{k}_1 f^*(k_1) \dd \tilde{k}_2 f(k_2) \lk k_1 |k_2\rk = \int \dd \tilde{k}_2 | f(k_2) |^2\]
In the last step, the just derived expression for the matrix element was used, and the $\delta$-function was evaluated, which reduced the double integral to just one. Thus, the norm is given by the quared wave function.\\
A normalizable $n$-particle state then is
\[ |n, F\rk = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ n! \int \dd \tilde{k}_1 \ldots \dd\tilde{k}_n | F(k_1, \ldots k_n) |^2}} \int \dd \tilde{k}_1 \ldots \dd \tilde{k}_n F(k_1, \ldots k_n) a^\dagger(k_1) \ldots a^\dagger(k_n) |0\rk\]
The $n!$ appears, because there are $n!$ permutations of the $a^\dagger$ which all yield the same result. $F$ is without loss of generality a bose function; even if it wasnt, only the Bose symmetric part of it would contribute. $F$ is therefore symmetric under exchange of two indices.\\
A state with $n$ particles in mode $\psi(k)$ then can be expressed as
\[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{n!}} \left( \int \dd \tilde{k} \psi(k) a^\dagger(k) \right)^n | 0 \rk\]
with $\int \dd \tilde{k} | \psi(k) |^2 = 1$. The expressin in the brackets is essentialy a wave package.
\sub{Complex Klein Gordon field}
The Lagrangian of a complex Klein Gordon field is
\[ \LL = ( \p_\mu \phi) ^* ( \p ^\mu \phi) - m^2 \phi^* \phi \]
from this also follows the Klein Gordon equation ($\square + m^2) \phi(x) = 0$.\\
We can now express the two complex fields as two separate real fields:
\[ \phi(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \phi_1(x) + i \phi_2(x) \right)\]
\[ \phi^*(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \phi_1(x) - i \phi_2(x) \right)\]
With these real fields $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ the Lagrangian is
\[ \LL = \frac{1}{2} ( \p_\mu \phi_1)^2 - \frac{m^2}{2} \phi_1^2 + \frac{1}{2} (\p_\mu\phi_2)^2 - \frac{m^2}{2} \phi_2^2\]
So we have two indepeandat, equivalent, real Klein Gordon fields of the same mass $m$. If we take a look at the canonical quantization
\[ [ \phi_i (\vx, t), \p_0 \phi_j(\vy, t) ] = i \delta_{ij} \delta^{(3)}( \vx - \vy) \]
the fields do commute for different indices $i$ and $j$. Thus they really are independant.\\
In terms of creation and annihilation operators we have
\[ \phi_i(x) = \int \dd \tilde{k} \left[ a_i(k) e^{-ikx} + a_i^\dagger(k) e^{ikx} \right]\]
This implies, that the complex filed is
\[ \phi(x) = \int \dd \tilde{k} \left[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(a_1(k) + i a_2(k)\right) e^{-ikx} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( a_1^\dagger(k) + i a_2^\dagger(k)\right)e^{ikx} \right]\]
We now call the expressions in the brackets $a(k)$ and $b^\dagger(k)$:
\[ a(k) \equiv a_1(k) + i a_2(k), ~~~ b(k) \equiv a_1(k) - i a_2(k)\]
These operators have a more physical interpretation than the $a_i(k)$.\\
We can now calculate the commutator
\[ [a(k), a^\dagger(p)] = (2\pi)^3 2 \omega_k \delta^{(3)}(\vp - \vv{k})\]
and similarly
\[ [b(k), b^\dagger(p)] = (2\pi)^3 2 \omega_k \delta^{(3)}(\vp - \vv{k})\]
also the mixed commutator vanishes: $[a(k), b^\dagger(k)] = 0$.\\
The four momentum operator $P^\mu$ which has been introduced earlier
\[ P^\mu = \int \dd \tilde{k} \cc k^\mu \left( a_1^\dagger(k) a_1(k) + a_2^\dagger(k) a_2(k)\right)\]
can now be written with the newly defined operators
\[ P^\mu = \int \dd \tilde{k} \cc k^\mu \left( a^\dagger(k) a(k) + b^\dagger(k) b(k) \right)\]
There is however no real advantage of using the new operators here, it basically is the same. A real difference emerges when looking at the conserved charge. Its current is given as
\[ j^\mu = -i:(\p^\mu \phi)\phi - \phi^\dagger(\p^\mu \phi)|\]
where the $:$-notation just means, ordering the terms in a way, that the vacuum state is zero. The conserved charge then is
\[ Q = \int \dd ^3 x j^0(x) = \int \dd \tilde{k} i \left( a_1^\dagger(k) a_2(k) - a_2^\dagger(k) a_1(k) \right)\]
for the old operators. This constellation of operators describes the taking away of particle 2 with $k$ and replacing it with particle 1 with momentum $k$ and vice versa for the second term. This is not a very clear and physical interpretation. However, if we write the charge with the new operators we find
\[  Q = \int \dd \tilde{k} \left( a^\dagger(k) a(k) - b^\dagger(k)b(k)\right)\]
Here are no mixed terms, so this can be interpreted as $N_a- N_b$, the difference in number of particles, where $N_a = a^\dagger a$ and similarly for $N_b$. This interpretation then yields, that $a^\dagger(k)$ creates particles of charge $Q = +1$ and $b^\dagger(k)$ creates anti particles with charge $Q = -1$. The total charge $Q = N_a - N_b$ is conserved, this even holds for interacting fields, as long as we have a $U(1)$ symmetry. So, the only posibility to change $N_a$ is a pair creation and annihilation.\\
An example of this formalism is the electric charge of $\pi^+$ and $\pi^-$ or the hyper charge or strangeness of $K^0$ and $\bar{K}^0$.
\sub{Covariant commutation relations}
Earlier we looked at equal time commutators, now lets take a more general approach. We first start the discussion just for real Klein Gordon fields
\[ \phi(x) = \int \dd \tilde{k} a(k) e^{-ikx} + \int \dd \tilde{k} a^\dagger(k) e^{ikx}\]
We now call the first term, the term for positive energy $\phi^+(x)$ and the second one, for negative energy $\phi^-(x)$. Now, the commutator for arbitrary, four dimensional $x$ and $y$ is given as
\[ [ \phi(x), \phi(y)] = [\phi^+(x) + \phi^-(x), \phi^+(y), \phi^-(y)]=[\phi^+(x), \phi^-(y)] + [ \phi^-(x), \phi^+(y)]\]
In the last step we used, that the remaining two commutators would vanish, because they are proportional to $[a(p),a(k)]$ or $[a^\dagger(p), a^\dagger(k)]$ which are equal to zero.  Now, as the first commutator is kinda the same as the second one, just with interchanged $x$ and $y$ we only calculate the first one
\[ [\phi^+(x), \phi^-(y)] = \int \dd \tilde{k}_1 \dd \tilde{k}_2 e^{-ik_1x} e^{ik_2x} [a(k_1), a^\dagger(k_2)] = \int \dd \tilde{k} e^{-ik(x-y)} \equiv i \Delta^+(x-y)\]
In the last step we again used the commutator relation $[ a(k_1), a^\dagger(k_2)] = (2\pi)^3 2 \omega_{k_1} \delta^{(3)} (\vv{k}_1 - \vv{k}_2)$. The resulting expression is called $i \Delta^+$, where $\Delta^+$ only depends on the difference $x-y$.\\
From this we get the whole commutator
\[ i \Delta(x-y) \equiv [ \phi(x), \phi(y)] = i \Delta^+(x-y) + i \Delta^-(x-y) = \int \dd\tilde{k} \left( e^{-ik(x-y)} - e^{ik(x-y)}\right)\]
This can be writtes as a sine, so that
\[ i\Delta(x) = -2 i\int \dd\tilde{k} \sin\left( k x\right)\]
Some properties of these functions $\Delta(x)$ are
\begin{itemize}
\item $\Delta(x)$ is Lorentz invariant, that is to say it is only dependant on $x^2$ and the sign of $x^0$ because only they are Lorentz invariant (?).
\item $\Delta(x-y)|_{x^0 = y^0}$ is the equal time commutator, which is zero. This implies that $\Delta(x-y) = 0$ for $(x-y)^2 <0$ because in some Lorentz frame $x'_0 = y'_0$ for the same physical point. In other words, the commutator will vanish outside of the forward and backward light cones. This is sometimes also called micro causality:\\
Measurements of fields $\phi$ at $x$ and $y$ are independat, that is to say, they do not influence each other, for space like separations. Since the signal between $x$ and $y$ would need to exceed the speed of light.
\end{itemize}
The explicit form of $\Delta(x)$ is
\[ i \Delta(x) = \frac{i}{4 \pi | \vx|} \frac{\p}{\p | \vx|} \begin{cases}
J_0 (m \sqrt{x^2}), ~~~~~~ x^0 > |\vx|\\
0 ,~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - | \vx| < x^0 | |\vx| \\
-J_0(m\sqrt{x^2}), ~~~~ x^0 < |\vx|
\end{cases}
\]
With the commutator, also the vacuum expectation value of two Klein Gordon fileds is calculatable
\[ \lk 0 | \phi(x) \phi(y) | 0 \rk = \lk 0 | \phi^+(x) \phi^-(y) | 0 \rk = \lk 0 | [\phi^+, \phi^-(y)] | 0\rk = \lk 0 | i \Delta^+(x-y) | 0  \rk \]
In the first step we used, that every other term would vanish, because it would be equal with $a(k)$ acting on $|0\rk$. In the second step we rewrote $\phi^+(x) \phi^-(y) = [\phi^+(x), \phi^-(y)] + \phi^-(y)\phi^+(x)$. The extra term vanishes though for the same reason. Now, because $\lk 0 | 0 \rk = 1$ we get
\[ \lk 0 | \phi(x) \phi(y) | 0 \rk = i \Delta^+ (x-y) = \int \frac{ \dd^3 \vv{k}}{(2\pi)^3 2 \omega_k} e^{-ik(x-y)}\]
